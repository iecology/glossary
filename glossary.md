**Backup**
Regularly updated copies of your digital assets, ideally
stored in several different places, so that if access to or integrity of
your data is disrupted for any reason (damage to computers due to
accident or natural disaster, accidental or malicious deletion of files,
etc.), the assets can be restored. Online backup services such as Mozy
and CrashPlan are best supplemented by backups stored on organizational
equipment and in secure offsite storage.

**Cookies**
Small files placed on your computer by websites that you
visit; they are used to manage website features such as logins and can
also be used to track behavior on the web. While not all cookies are a
security risk, if poorly implemented they can expose the information
they contain. More information about cookies is available at
http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.

**Digital assets**
Any and all data electronically stored or used by
your organization. This includes your organization's files, website,
emails, social media accounts, online banking accounts, etc. Some of
these items may be ones that you administer yourself (e.g., the contents
of staff hard drives, file repositories stored on servers owned and
controlled by your organization); others may be maintained by
third-party services on your behalf (e.g., files on Google Drive or
Box). Others are services that you participate in that are owned and
controlled by others (subject to terms of service), such as
organizational Facebook pages.

**DKIM records**
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is a system to
protect email from abuse, both from forged sender addresses and from
content alteration. The system operates at the server level so requires
help from your email provider to setup.

**Domain Name System.**The domain name system (DNS) is like a phone book
for the Internet. It translates domain names (such as
roadmapconsulting.org or whitehouse.gov) into the numbers (ip addresses)
used to find services on the Internet. It can also be used to store
other information about your organizatio's informatio systems, such as
SPF records or DKIM keys.

**Encryption**
A mechanism by which your data scrambled in order to
protect it from being read by unauthorized parties. Authorized parties
have are able to decrypt (i.e., unscramble) it. There are many different
ways to encrypt communications and other digital assets.

**Encryption Key.**An encryption key is a piece of information that you
share with an authorized party so they can encrypt and/or decrypt
information to or from you. In most cases this information is highly
sensitive and needs to be protected however modern encryption schemes
allow you to have a “public” key that you can safely share with anyone.

**Extensions**
Small pieces of software that you install as part of
your web browser in order to give your browser additional capabilities.

**Firewall.**A piece of software or hardware device that analyzes and
selectively blocks or alters information passing between two networks.
Common places to find firewalls are between your office network and the
Internet and on your computer to protect you from other computers on
your office network.

**Office network**
The equipment in your office that allows staff
computers to connect to each other, on site resources such as file
servers and to the Internet. If you cannot trust that nobody else is
controlling this network your security progress will be compromised.

**Password manager software**
Software that keeps your passwords in an
encrypted format, protected by a master password. This allows you to
store multiple passwords by remembering only one. Password managers are
available as software that you install (e.g., KeePass) and as a
web-based service (e.g., LastPass). While web-based password managers
can be secure enough to hold the passwords staff use to access their
accounts for everyday purposes, they are not recommended to store the
passwords that grant administrative access to core organizational
accounts.

**Security certificates**
Security certificates are a specific kind of
file that includes an encryption key, and often times additional
information about that key. Websites such as used for banking and other
services frequently use them to allow you to establish a secure
connection with their servers.

**SPF records**
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a system that allows
you to tell others what servers and services are allowed to send email
for your organization's domain name. Setting up this record requires the
assistance of your DNS provider and can have unintended negative
consequences for your email delivery if not properly done.

**Virtual Private Network (VPN)**
A connection between computers that
them to exchange information in an encrypted form. This can allow you to
both “tunnel out of” a network you don't trust or to get you access to
information on your office network from someplace else on the Internet.

**Wireless Access Point.**A wireless access point (WAP) is a piece of
hardware configured to host a wireless network. In many small networks
the WAP will also be a firewall separating the network from the rest of
the Internet.

**WEP, WPA and WPA2**
All are methods of encrypting wireless network
traffic between a device like a computer or phone and a wireless access
point. WEP is an older encryption method and it is far less secure than
WPA and WPA2, which are newer methods.
