**Tor**
*tool type:* networking software  
*security features:* censorship circumvention, anonymity protections, secure hidden services  
*license terms:* open source  
*operating systems:* Windows, OSX, Linux  

Tor is the software underlying the Tor network, Tor Browser, TorBirdy and other tools. Certain devices using Tor software act as relays passing along information securely between each other to create a global network. When you run Tor software on your device your connections to websites and other services bounce through several points in this network before connecting you. This protects your ip address and location information from being revealed while also potentially bypassing censorship or other filtering within your country, office or other network.

Additionally Tor provides a system of self-authenticating, anonymous services formerly known as "Hidden Sites" and now called the "Onion web" The Tor Browser Bundle and Tor Messenger software includes and utilizes Tor software. TorBirdy depends on Tor software but does not currently

**Tor Browser Bundle**  
*tool type:* web browser    
*features:* anonymity, circumvention, Tor hidden service access    
*license terms:* open source  
*operating systems:* Windows, OSX, Linux  
A highly customized Firefox web browser that comes preconfigured to use the included tor software and to protect your privacy. The browser also allows access to hidden services or the "Onion Web" -- a set of strongly authenticated anonymous services available through the Tor network.

**TorBirdy**  
*tool type:* Thunderbird add-on
*features:* Tor access, anonymity for email    
*license terms:* open source  
*operating systems:* Windows, OSX, Linux  
A Thunderbird add-on that changes it to send email through the Tor network. Because email is easily tracked, TorBirdy also changes the settings in Thunderbird to try to limit the amount of information that leaks about the computer and person sending the email. TorBirdy is experimental software and it is highly recommended that it is not installed on a computer needing to use Thunderbird for day-to-day, insecure email functions without careful consideration.
